SENTIMENT140 LEXICON
--------------------
The Sentiment140 Lexicon is a list of words and their associations with
positive and negative sentiment. The lexicon is distributed in three files:
unigrams-pmilexicon.txt, bigrams-pmilexicon.txt, and pairs-pmilexicon.txt.

Each line in the three files has the format:

term<tab>sentimentScore<tab>numPositive<tab>numNegative
where:
   term 
      In unigrams-pmilexicon.txt, term is a unigram (single word).
	  In bigrams-pmilexicon.txt, term is a bigram (two-word sequence).
	  A bigram has the form: "string string". The bigram was seen at least once in 
	  the source tweets from which the lexicon was created. 
	  In pairs-pmilexicon.txt, term is a unigram--unigram pair,
      unigram--bigram pair, bigram--unigram pair, or a bigram--bigram pair.
	  The pairs were generated from a large set of source tweets. Tweets were 
	  examined one at a time, and all possible unigram and bigram combinations 
	  within the tweet were chosen. Pairs with certain punctuations, @ symbols,
	  and some function words were removed.

	  
   sentimentScore is a real number. A positive score indicates positive 
      sentiment. A negative score indicates negative sentiment. The absolute 
      value is the degree of association with the sentiment.
	  The sentiment score was calculated by subtracting the pointwise mutual
	  information (PMI) score of the term with positive emoticons and the
	  PMI of the term with negative emoticons. 
	  
	  Terms with a non-zero PMI score with positive emoticons and PMI score of 0 
	  with negative emoticons were assigned a sentimentScore of 5.
	  Terms with a non-zero PMI score with negative emoticons and PMI score of 0 
	  with positive emoticons were assigned a sentimentScore of -5.

   numPositive is the number of times the term co-occurred with a positive 
      marker such as a positive emoticon or a positive emoticons.

   numNegative is the number of times the term co-occurred with a negative 
      marker such as a negative emoticon or a negative emoticons.

The Sentiment140 Lexicon was created from the Sentiment140 emoticon corpus of 1.6 million tweets.
