Just a few notes on processing here.

From the raw dictionary I removed the header into the _words variant.
Then I actually had to manually remove the second "I'm" and "I've", they're duplicates and we don't need duplicates in our analysis. "wrote" is also a duplicate
wrote	11	13
I also had to remove "like":
like	(02 134)125/464	(02 134)126	253
